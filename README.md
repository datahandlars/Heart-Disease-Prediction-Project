# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Project
The goal of this project is to train a model so that it predicts whether a person is likely to suffer from heart disease (whether the probability is above or below 50%).

This dataset  used is called the Heart Disease dataset and has been published in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset originally contained 75 attributes, but only 14 of those attributes have been used by published experiments. The same subset will be used for this project.
